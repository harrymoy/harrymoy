# Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Harry. A software engineer working for a FinTech. For my day job I write Java code and am now experimening with Clojure.

In the past I worked in .NET programming and led a team of developers building a credit check system for a financial services company in the UK.

I bought Bitcoin in 2013 (and sold in 2013) and I'm a big DeFi fan. So I'm learning Solidity and building dApps to learn more and contribute to the DeFi community. 

I write as well in my spare time, you can find me [here](https://harrymoy.com) where I write about anything that comes to my head. You can also find me on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/HarryMoy)
