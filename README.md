# Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Harry. A cloud architect from the West Midlands in ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.

In the past I worked in .NET programming and led a team of developers building a credit check system for a financial services company in the UK. I now program in my spare time and when I can find an excuse to in my day-to-day job.

### ðŸ¦‡ðŸ”Š 
I bought Bitcoin in 2013 (and sold in 2013) and I'm a big DeFi fan. So I'm learning Solidity and building dApps to learn more and contribute to the DeFi community. 

I write as well in my spare time, you can find me [here](https://harrymoy.com) where I write about anything that comes to my head. You can also find me on [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/HarryMoy)
